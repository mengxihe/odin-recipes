        <h3>Braising Liquid:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle lager beer</li>
            <li>1 onion, cut into large slices</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons pickling spice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place water, 3 bottles beer, 2 onions, kosher salt, 1/2 cup brown sugar, curing salt, 1/4 cup pickling spice, and 2 tablespoons garlic in a very large pot. Stir well until salts are dissolved. Add beef; stir gently. Use a large bowl or heavy plate to keep the beef submerged. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, stirring once a day, for 4 days.
            </li>
            <li>
                Soak wood chips in apple juice for 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove beef from pot, discarding brine, and rinse well until cold water. Let beef come to room temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat an outdoor grill to 150 to 175 degrees F (65 to 80 degrees C). Place soaked wood chips in a shallow aluminum pan on the heat source.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place meat directly on the grate and allow to smoke for 2 hours
            </li>
            <li>Combine 1 beer, 1 onion, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tablespoons pickling spice, 2 tablespoons chopped garlic, and black pepper in a large saucepan; bring to a boil. Remove from heat and pour into a large roasting pan. Place beef in braising liquid in the roasting pan and cover tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Increase grill temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Place the roasting pan on the grill and close the lid.</li>
            <li>Roast the beef until tender, 3 to 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove beef from the roasting pan, discarding braising liquid. Let beef cool until easily handled.</li>
            <li>Slice beef into very thin slices across the grain.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cook's Notes:</h3>
        <p>Substitute apple juice for the beer if preferred.</p>
        <p>Use 2 smaller briskets instead of 1 large if desired. Use 1 tablespoon curing salt per pound of beef.</p>
        <p>You may finish cooking the beef in the oven instead of on the grill in step 7.</p>
