        <h2 class="text">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>Â½ pound bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>5 unpeeled potatoes, diced</li>
            <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams with juice</li>
            <li>2 (1.8 ounce) packages dry leek soup mix</li>
            <li>1 quart half-and-half</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text">Steps</h2>

            <li>
                Place the bacon in a large pot and cook over medium-high heat, 
                stirring occasionally, until crisped and browned, about 10 minutes. 
                Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon, leaving the drippings in the pot. 
                Set the bacon aside. Stir the potatoes and carrots into the bacon fat. 
                Season with salt and pepper, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the juice from the clams into the pot, and add enough water to just cover the potatoes. 
                Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are
                just tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gently stir the leek soup mix into the potatoes until no lumps of soup remain. 
                Stir in the clams, reserved bacon, and half-and-half cream. 
                Cook and stir until the chowder returns to a simmer and thickens, about 10 minutes more.
            </li>
